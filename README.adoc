cd into complete

then run the application using ./gradlew bootRun

Now that the service is up, visit http://localhost:8080, where you see:

When you click on the link, it attempts to take you to the greeting page at `/hello`. But because that page is secured and you have not yet logged in, it takes you to the login page:

NOTE: If you jumped down here with the unsecured version, then you won't see this login page. Feel free to back up and write the rest of the security-based code.

At the login page, sign in as the test user by entering "user" and "password" for the username and password fields, respectively. Once you submit the login form, you are authenticated and then taken to the greeting page, where you see:

  {"ladder":["code","cade","cate","date","data"]}

Provide a w1 query string parameter with http://localhost:8080/greeting?w1=cade. 

Notice the page changes to:

  {"ladder":["cade","cate","date","data"]}

You can provide w2 and dictionaryFileName parameters as well.
